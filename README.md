# CO 513 - Microprocessors and Microcontrollers

Welcome to **CO 513**!  
In this course, students will gain a deep understanding of **ARM v7 programming**, specifically using the [CPUlator ARMv7 DE1-SoC simulator](https://cpulator.01xz.net/?sys=arm-de1soc).  

The course introduces the fundamentals of assembly language programming, focusing on the ARM architecture. By the end of the semester, students will be equipped to write, debug, and optimize ARM assembly programs and understand the inner workings of microprocessors and microcontrollers.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand the ARM v7 architecture and instruction set.
- Write, debug, and execute ARM assembly language programs.
- Use the CPUlator ARMv7 DE1-SoC simulator effectively.
- Explore the relationship between hardware and software at the instruction level.
- Analyze and implement low-level solutions for microprocessor-based problems.
